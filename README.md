# A fast and convinient Go library for solving quadratic equations
## ⚙️ Installation

First, initialize your project with Go modules by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go mod init github.com/your/repo
```

To learn more about Go modules and how they work, you can check out the [Using Go Modules](https://go.dev/blog/using-go-modules) blog post.

After setting up your project, you can install this module with the `go get` command:

```bash
go get -u github.com/Gregory-coder/quadratic-equation-solver
```

This command fetches the package and adds it to your project's dependencies, allowing you to start building your web applications.
